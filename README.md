## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Geolocation filtering**: Filters restaurants within a defined radius using LocationIQ API.  
2. **Content-based filtering**: Compares restaurant data using cosine similarity for personalized recommendations.  
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Enhances the recommendation system by matching user inputs with restaurant names, even if the input isn’t exact.  
4. **Preference and budget filtering**: Ensures that only restaurants matching the user’s requirements are shown.
